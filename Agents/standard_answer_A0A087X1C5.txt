"This human protein, A0A087X1C5, known by its gene name CYP2D7, is a member of the cytochrome P450 family, characteristic of its PF00067 domain. It is involved in diverse metabolic activities, particularly in the processing of foreign compounds.\n\n**1. Molecular Function (MF) - Biochemical activity of the protein**\nA0A087X1C5 functions as an oxidoreductase, specifically exhibiting oxidoreductase activity where it acts on paired donors with the incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen. This defines it as a monooxygenase, utilizing reduced flavin or flavoprotein as one donor and incorporating one atom of oxygen into its substrates. Its catalytic activity is dependent on the binding of heme and iron ions, crucial cofactors for cytochrome P450 enzymes. The protein is implicated in the metabolism of various xenobiotics, including many drugs and environmental chemicals, through oxidation. Notably, it has been suggested to play a role in the metabolism of codeine, converting it to morphine, a key step in drug activation. However, this specific function has not been consistently confirmed across studies (PubMed:15051713, PubMed:18838503). Additionally, the protein displays aromatase activity, indicating a potential role in the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds.\n\n**2. Biological Process (BP) - Biological processes the protein participates in**\nThe primary biological role of A0A087X1C5 is centered on xenobiotic metabolic processes and xenobiotic catabolic processes. This means it is involved in the breakdown and detoxification (or sometimes bioactivation) of foreign chemical compounds encountered by the body. Its contribution to drug metabolism is significant, potentially influencing the efficacy, dosage, and toxicity of various pharmaceutical agents. Beyond xenobiotics, it is also involved in arachidonate metabolic processes, suggesting a role in the metabolism of endogenous lipids, which can produce signaling molecules. Variations in its activity could therefore impact individual responses to drug treatments and contribute to the understanding of drug-drug interactions and individual metabolic profiles.\n\n**3. Cellular Component (CC) - Cellular localization of the protein**\nA0A087X1C5 is an integral membrane protein, equipped with transmembrane helices that anchor it to cellular membranes. It is primarily localized within intracellular membrane-bounded organelles, with a specific presence in the mitochondrion. While largely membrane-associated, it also has a cytoplasmic component, possibly reflecting transient interactions or presence within the cytoplasm before or after membrane insertion. As a glycoprotein, it may undergo post-translational modifications, which can influence its localization, stability, or activity."
