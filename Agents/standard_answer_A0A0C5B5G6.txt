"This entry describes a small peptide (A0A0C5B5G6) in Homo sapiens, often referred to as a mitochondrially-encoded peptide (e.g., MOTS-c-like), derived from the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene, MT-RNR1. This peptide acts as a crucial signaling molecule with diverse and potent roles in metabolic regulation, cellular stress response, and tissue growth.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Molecular Function (MF) - Biochemical activity of the protein\n\nThe MT-RNR1-derived peptide functions as a multifaceted metabolic and signaling regulator. It notably inhibits the folate cycle, which leads to a reduction in *de novo* purine biosynthesis. This inhibition results in the accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) and, consequently, the activation of the metabolic master regulator 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (PubMed:25738459).\n\nUnder conditions of metabolic stress, this peptide exhibits direct DNA-binding activity. It translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) present in the promoter regions of various genes (PubMed:29983246). This interaction enables it to regulate nuclear gene expression in an NFE2L2-dependent manner, thereby contributing to increased cellular resistance to metabolic stress.\n\nBeyond its direct DNA-binding, the peptide also profoundly influences key signaling pathways by modulating protein kinase and phosphatase activities. It positively regulates the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase complex mTORC2 and negatively regulates the PTEN phosphatase, promoting AKT phosphorylation (PubMed:33554779). This cascade further leads to AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO1, which reduces FOXO1 activity and its downstream effects (PubMed:33554779).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Biological Process (BP) - Biological processes the protein participates in\n\nThe MT-RNR1-derived peptide plays a central role in maintaining **metabolic homeostasis and stress response**. It is critical for regulating insulin sensitivity and protects against both age-dependent and diet-induced insulin resistance, as well as diet-induced obesity (PubMed:25738459). By influencing the folate cycle, it indirectly regulates the purine-containing compound biosynthetic process. It also contributes to the regulation of carbohydrate utilization, increases mitochondrial respiration, and elevates levels of CPT1A. Its actions collectively enhance cellular resistance to various forms of metabolic stress.\n\nIn terms of **tissue growth and differentiation**, this peptide is a potent stimulator. Through its modulation of the AKT-FOXO1 pathway, it reduces levels of MSTN, thereby promoting skeletal muscle tissue growth (PubMed:33554779). Furthermore, it is a key promoter of osteogenesis; it drives osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and enhances osteoblast proliferation. These osteogenic effects, including the promotion of osteoblast synthesis of type I collagens (COL1A1 and COL1A2), are mediated via the TGFB/SMAD pathway (PubMed:30468456, PubMed:31081069).\n\nThe peptide is also involved in **gene regulation and inflammatory responses**. In response to metabolic stress, its nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity facilitate the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and overall nuclear gene expression. In senescent cells, it increases the levels of several pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, including IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL10, and TNF (PubMed:29886458), suggesting a role in cellular communication and adaptive responses in aging or stressed tissues.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Cellular Component (CC) - Cellular localization of the protein\n\nThis peptide exhibits dynamic and diverse cellular localization, reflecting its wide-ranging functions. It originates and is found within the **mitochondrion**, consistent with its encoding by mitochondrial DNA.\n\nIn response to metabolic stress, it demonstrates a crucial translocation to the **nucleus**, where it exerts its gene regulatory functions by binding to DNA (PubMed:29983246).\n\nSignificantly, the peptide is also capable of being **secreted** and is detected in the **extracellular space**. This suggests its role as an endocrine-like signaling molecule, capable of acting at a systemic level to coordinate metabolic and cellular responses across different tissues.\n\n---\n\n**Domain and Functional Site Analysis:**\nThe protein sequence MRWQEMGYIFYPRKLR itself constitutes the functional entity. This peptide is classified under Pfam PF21945, which specifically refers to peptides derived from mitochondrial 12S rRNA, confirming its identity as a functional product separate from the full rRNA molecule. Its specific amino acid sequence is critical for its diverse functional roles, including its ability to bind DNA and modulate key signaling enzymes like kinases and phosphatases. The \"DNA-binding\" keyword highlights a critical functional characteristic of this small peptide."
